We are going to make a punctuation for each category awarding 2 points to the winner, 1 point to second one and 0 points to the third one.



1. BARS - NIGHT CLUBS

Compared the category bars, night clubs in order to see the best city with this item. Its an important aspect because as we know all te workers are young and they would like to have some night life around the office. The analysis was made with 1km around the selected point from each city. After anylising it we found the following results.

Montreal
I have found that they are 28 bars, pubs and night clubs in the area of Montreal. 0 POINTS

Toronto
Toronto has a total of 27 bars, pubs and night clubs in the area. 1 POINT

In this category we cannot make any decisions as in all the cities the is a diverse range of places.


2. SCHOOLS 

As 30% of the workers have children is it crutial to analyse the number of schools present in the city area, near the company. As we know a lot of workers would like to leave their children in the morning and pick them up on the afternoon. For this category we set a radius of 2km arouund the possible office. We found the following results.

Montreal
In Montreal there are 18 different schools within 2km radius. It is a wide range of schools from where the parents could choose their children education. There are also high schools and University for the older ones. 1 POINT

Toronto
In Toronto we find 20 different schools in the 2km radius. The offer is similar to Montreal. Workers can be satisfied with the options. There are also present High Schools and Universities. We have to say that in Toronto is present the best university of Canada, University of Toronto, that is a plus point for the city. 2 POINTS

Ottawa
In Ottawa we can find only 10 schools in a 2km radius, Schools in Ottawa are spread out the bussiness center, so workers would have to find solutions like driving the to school. That can be an inconvinient for some workers. 0 POINTS

Montreal
In Mointreal the is the Montr√©al-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport at 15.323km from the chosen location, it's not far away and within 15-20 minutes workers could be in the airport. 0 POINTS

Toronto
In Toronto the are two important airports. The Toronto Pearson International Airport, known for being the airport with more flights/year so it's the most important airport in Canada. The positive thing from Toronto is that also has another important airport, the Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport, this airport also operates internationally and its only 2,5km from the choosen office location. 2 POINTS
